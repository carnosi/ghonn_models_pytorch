# GHONN Models Pytorch

## Introduction
In this repo we introduce pytorch implementation for the HONU (Higher Order Neural Units), HONN (Higher Order Neural Networks) and GHONN (Gated Higher Order Neural Networks) models.

All of these models are relatively small with intended use on sequential sensoric data, therefore we do not provide any pretrained models.

The models rely on eachother and build up hierarchically, where the foundational model is HONU out of which we can build HONN or GHONN.

## Features
TBD

## How to install
TBD

## Example Usage
TBD

## Jupyter Examples
TBD

## Requirements
The code has been tested with __python==3.12__ and __pytorch==0.2.6__ and the installation requirements are defined in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt).

## Tips & Tricks
TBD

## Application Examples
The following papers rely on the legacy code instead of the current pytorch version, however the usage target is the same with the pytorch implementation beeing simpler.
TBD.
