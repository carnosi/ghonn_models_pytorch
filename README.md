## Introduction
**GHONN Models Pytorch** brings advanced neural architectures to your PyTorch projects: Higher Order Neural Units (HONU), Higher Order Neural Networks (HONN), Gated Higher Order Neural Units (gHONU), and Gated Higher Order Neural Networks (gHONN).

‚ú® **Polynomial neurons at the core:** These models excel at capturing complex, nonlinear relationships‚Äîespecially when working with polynomial signals. Their adaptable design makes them a strong choice for a wide range of machine learning tasks.

üîó **Gated variants for extra power:** The gated architectures use a dual HONU neuron setup‚Äîone as a dynamic gate, the other as the main predictor‚Äîenabling richer and more expressive modeling.

üõ†Ô∏è **Modular and flexible:** Build your own architectures with ease. Layers can be stacked directly or connected via linear mappings, giving you full control over your network‚Äôs structure.

üëâ **Curious how it works in practice?** Check out the example notebooks and usage guides included in this repository.

## Requirements & Installation

- **Python:** 3.12 or newer
- **PyTorch:** 2.7.0 or newer

To install the package (once released on PyPI), use your preferred package manager:

**With pip:**
```bash
pip install ghonn-models-pytorch
```

**With uv:**
```bash
uv pip install ghonn-models-pytorch
```

Or, to install from source:


```bash
git clone https://github.com/carnosi/ghonn_models_pytorch.git
cd ghonn_models_pytorch
pip install .
```
Or, with **[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)**:

```bash
uv pip install .
```

## Features

**Neuron Types** ‚ö°
- **HONU:** The fundamental building block for higher-order modeling. For example, a 2nd order HONU is defined as:

  ![HONU equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\dpi{120}\bg_white\tilde{y}(k)=\sum_{i=0}^{n}\sum_{j=i}^{n}w_{i,j}x_ix_j=\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathrm{col}^{r=2}(\mathbf{x}))

  where:
  - $\tilde{y}(k)$ is the neuron output for input sample $k$
  - $w_{i,j}$ are the learnable weights
  - $x_i, x_j$ are input features
  - $\mathbf{w}$ is the weight vector
  - $\mathrm{col}^{r=2}(\mathbf{x})$ is the column vector of all 2nd order combinations of input features
  - $r$ is the polynomial order

  This structure ensures polynomial relationships between input datapoints and high computation performance.
- **gHONU:** Combines two HONUs‚Äîone as a predictor (typically linear activation), the other as a dynamic gate (e.g., `tanh`)‚Äîmultiplying their outputs for enhanced ability to capture complex patterns.

**Network Layers** üß©
- **HONN:** Single-layer networks of HONU neurons. Supports both raw outputs for stacking and linear heads for custom output dimensions.
- **gHONN:** Single-layer networks of gHONU neurons, with the same flexible output options as HONN.

**Key Advantages** üöÄ
- **Efficient high-order computation:** Redesigned polynomial order assignment enables fast calculations even at high polynomial orders (up to 10th order and beyond) even on CPUs.
- **Seamless PyTorch integration:** All components are implemented as standard PyTorch modules for easy use in your projects.
- **Customizable & modular:** Layers and neurons can be stacked, combined, or adapted to suit a wide range of architectures and tasks.
- **Supports regression & classification:** Suitable for both regression and classification problems.
- **Ready-to-use examples:** Example notebooks and usage guides are included in this repo to help you get started quickly.

## Examples & Usage

- Explore step-by-step Jupyter notebooks in the [examples](./examples/) folder for practical demonstrations and implementation tips.
- Example usage patterns and code snippets will be added soon.

```python
# Example usage coming soon!
```

## Tips & Tricks
* In the case of GHONU based units it is often benefitial to have different initial learning rate between the two neurons.
* more TBD
